<h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>

<h5>Is Chess hard to learn ?</h5>
<p>Not at all. I've tought myself to play. There are only a few pieces and a couple of other moves you need to know. 
Learning to play legal moves is very easy. You only have six types of pieces which have very well defined (not so complicated) moves. Then, there are some special moves and situation (which you can learn about when you are little experienced in basic moves). These basic moves are like addition/substraction of mathematics whose combination and composition gives you power to make complicated stragegies (as an analogy, most of the mathematical functions finally boils down to these basic operations).
If you know the basics and were given infinite time (you'd need this to make a large amount of notes about possible moves), you could probably hold your own against a grand master. Problem is, you don't have infinite time and you'll need to make decisions and predict and plan many, many moves ahead. </p>


<h5>What is the Algebraic notation in chess ?</h5>
<p>There are actually two systems one descriptive, and one geometric. The geometric grid is more commonly used, but I personally prefer the descriptive.


 
When a move is described, the turn number leads the way, followed by the white piece designation and square he is on followed by a dash telling where the piece ended up. This is followed by a comma and the same information for black's move. This is all done from the point of view of white. Pawn moves usually leave off the P as they are assumed. It would look something like this:<br>

This has the white pushing out his queen pawn two squares and black responding with his king's knight.
<br>
I think that this gives you the gist of it.</p>


<h5>Can I take the other player's piece with my King if it has me in check ?</h5>
<p> The king may take any opposing piece. However, the king may not move into check when doing so. This means that an opposing queen may be positioned right next to your king as long as that queen is protected. This rule causes a bit of confusion for beginning players, because it seems as though the king can be attacked with impunity. But this is not the case. An attack on the king must be meticulously planned, and attacks that come next to the king must be doubly well-planned. Often, in beginner and intermediate play, the attacks that are most likely to succeed in this way involve the queen and a knight. Because knights do not move in straight lines their attack can be devious and combined with the power of the queen, the attack can be devastating.
<br>
<br>
The purpose of a check is not always to capture the king. It can also be to take advantage of a fork. This is attacking two pieces at once with a single piece so the opponent is forced to move one or the other. In this case the player must choose to either defend or move his king or eliminate the threat.</p>


<h5>What if my opponent puts my King in check and doesn't say "check" ?</h5>
<p> If your opponent places your king in check and then forgets to say check, he is in no way penalized. Saying "check" or "check-mate" is really just a courtesy in chess. It is a way to tell the opponent that he is in danger and must look to his king. It is especially useful in games between beginners because it helps to keep focus on the game. However, if someone does not notice that his or her piece is in check and try to move something that does not get the king out of check, the person should be reminded that the king may NOT be left exposed to attack.
<br>
Believe it or not some players take it as an insult if the opponent says "check" because it implies that the player is not paying attention. In a friendly game it is polite. In a trash-talking scenario, it can also be used to good effect. However, neither you or I would talk trash to an opponent. Would we?</p>

<h5>How many queens can I have on the board at a time ?</h5>
<p>This can be a bit perplexing as most chess sets only provide one queen per side. But players should remember that pieces are only representations and any appropriate sized object can be used to represent a queen. It might be a coin or even a wadded up piece of paper. The fact is that any pawn reaching the opponent's side of the board is entitled to be a queen. This means that eight pawns could, in theory be promoted. Coupled with the queen, this would mean that a player could have nine queens.
<br>
This is highly unlikely and a practical impossibility unless both players are cooperating to make it happen. I have never seen a player with more than three queens on the board at once in competitive play, and three is rare. Because the play would have to be extremely lopsided to get more than three queens on the board, the game is usually over by check-mate or resignation before such an event occurs.
<br>
As a practical matter, if a player promotes a pawn while still in possession of the original queen, an inverted rook can be used to represent the new queen. Alternatively, find a wadded up piece of paper to stand in.</p>


<h5>What is a fork in Chess ?</h5>
<p>A fork occurs when a piece simultaneously attacks two separate pieces. For the new player there are two very dangerous forks. The first involves the knight. As can be seen in the diagram at left, the knight's position is directly in front of the bishop in the ever-vulnerable f7 square. It is impossible for the king to capture the knight because the knight is protected by the white bishop in the c4 square. The knight is simultaneously attacking both the queen and the rook. Black may only save the queen.
<br>
The knight because of its unusual movement is especially good at setting up forks. This means that a player should always look at least two moves ahead for possibilities for his own knight every turn. For safety's sake, he should also look at the possibilities for his opponent's knights so they can be forestalled.
<br>
The second very dangerous fork involves a simple pawn. Whenever two higher ranked pieces sit on the same rank with one square between them, they are vulnerable to a pawn fork. A protected pawn, pushed forward at the right moment, can catch two such pieces unawares. Watch out for it!</p>

<h5>When is a chess move complete ?</h5>
<p> A move is complete when the player moving the piece removes his hand from the piece. Period.
<br>
Another aspect of moving people don't discuss much: Technically, when a player touches a piece, he must move that piece unless he is adjusting or straightening the pieces on the board. At which time he must announce that this is his intention. Adjusting is often used as a cloak to avoid having to move a piece that a player touched with the intention of moving, but had second thoughts about. This is why, in sandlot chess most players will allow a player to touch and half-move a piece and simply put it back to choose another. But even in sandlot chess, when the hand is removed, after the piece has moved, the move is considered complete.
<br>
Often a good player will let a beginner off lightly and allow a move to be retracted. I played a grand master once in a friendly game and he offered to reset the board three moves back. I took him up on it and ended up getting skunked anyway.</p>
<h5>What is the fastest way to win chess ?</h5>
<p>It is possible, but highly unlikely, to win a chess game in two moves. But to do so requires playing black and the cooperation of the player using white.
The board at left shows the position of the pieces for a two move win. The first move by white would be the king's bishop pawn forward 2 squares (f4). Black would then move the king's pawn to e6. White, either totally oblivious or in a very obliging mood, would move the king's knight pawn to g4. Executing the coup de main, the black queen would move to h4.
<br>
There is no way to block the queen and the king cannot retreat. It is good to know that this can happen for both black and white because it can inform later play. It shows that both kings are vulnerable to a quick strike when restricted by undeveloped pieces in the early game. Play using tactics that develop pieces around the king, giving him protection and room to run when necessary.</p>


<h5>What is the point value of each chess piece?</h5>
<p>In order to evaluate a chess position, and to determine whether certain piece exchanges are a good idea or not, people have introduced point values to pieces. Of course, chess isn't won by collecting points, but by mating the opponent. So, even when you are many points ahead, but your opponent can mate you in one turn, you're position is very bad. So, the point values should be taken just as a guideline. Also, some people have slightly different values.
   <br><br>
Pawn: 1 point<br>
Knight: 3 points<br>
Bishop: 3 points<br>
Rook: 5 points<br>
Queen: 9 points (some people say: 8, others say: 10)<br>
King: infinitely many points</p>
