<h1>ADVANCED STRATEGY</h1>

<p>Chess is a strategy game, and the more strategies you know and understand, the better your chances at outsmarting your opponent. When combined with good playing tactics, advanced chess strategies can help you gain an edge and win the game. Chess strategy involves setting and achieving long-term goals in the game, and tactics require you to focus on the immediate move. They always go together, since strategic goals are typically achieved with good tactics, and tactical opportunities are based on a previous strategy of play. Chess lessons can be a great way to develop advanced chess strategies and improve your tactics. Here are the five best advanced stress strategies you are likely to learn by taking up chess lessons.
  <br>
<br>
Strategy at the advanced level is filled with subtlety. You'll need to master transformations, exchanges, dynamics, and structures. What do those words even mean, and how could they lead to won games?!
Many key mistakes in chess are related to mishandling dynamics and prematurely releasing tension in a position. Even grandmasters struggle with these issues. The only way to master dynamics and tension is through careful analysis and study of positions where such problems exist.
<br>
<br>
Intermediate and advance players have stocks of strategies and tricks to better stay ahead of their opponents. Strategies are what they have learned through experience of winning and losing the game. Learning the chess tactics is important to efficiently maneuver your pieces. Chess tactics are moves that will control your opponent’s option to attack, and it is a big advantage in your part.
<br>
<br>
Plan a strong openings, it is important for the rest of the game to achieve a possible chances of winning. This is where both players are trying to developed a steady and strong control of their pieces. This is the chance to push and build a strong position to attack. With a strong opening you are able to control the d4, e4, d5, and e5, the four important squares in the middle of the chess board we have discussed earlier.
<br>
<br>
The middle game is the most crucial part, having your pieces in a strong position is an advantage. The middle game is where both players are trying to attack and capture pieces until few left on the board. This is where both players are trying to position for the endgame.
<br>
<br>
Balance Your Moves, Hold Pieces Hostage
Your opponents will definitely pushing his pieces to attack you. This is where you pull out your techniques to fight back and protect your own pieces while you hold down your opponents pieces. Know the value of chess pieces. If you know the value of each chess pieces, it is easy to decide to push, move or fight back your opponents piece. Good example is if you can trade a knight to a rook.

<h5>CASTLING</h5>
<p>
  Castling is a move in the game of chess involving a player's king and either of the player's original rooks. It is the only move in chess in which a player moves two pieces in the same move, and it is the only move aside from the knight's move where a piece can be said to "jump over" another.[1]
<br>
<br>

Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook on the player's first rank, then moving the rook to the square over which the king crossed.[2] Castling may only be done if the king has never moved, the rook involved has never moved, the squares between the king and the rook involved are unoccupied, the king is not in check, and the king does not cross over or end on a square in which it would be in check. Castling is one of the rules of chess and is technically a king move (Hooper & Whyld 1992:71).
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h5>EN PASSANT</h5>
<p>
En passant (French: [ɑ̃ paˈsɑ̃], lit. in passing) is a move in chess.[1] It is a special pawn capture that can only occur immediately after a pawn makes a double-step move from its starting square, and it could have been captured by an enemy pawn had it advanced only one square. The opponent captures the just-moved pawn "as it passes" through the first square. The result is the same as if the pawn had advanced only one square and the enemy pawn had captured it normally.
<br>
<br>

The en passant capture must be made on the very next turn or the right to do so is lost.[2] Like any other move, if an en passant capture is the only legal move available, it must be played. En passant capture is a common theme in chess compositions.
<br>
<br>
The en passant capture rule was added in the 15th century when the rule that gave pawns an initial double-step move was introduced. It prevents a pawn from using the two-square advance to pass an adjacent enemy pawn without the risk of being captured.

<h5>PAWN PROMOTION</h5>
<p>
  Promotion is a chess rule that requires a pawn that reaches its eighth rank to be immediately replaced by the player's choice of a queen, knight, rook, or bishop of the same color.[1] The new piece replaces the pawn on the same square, as part of the same move. The choice of new piece is not limited to pieces previously captured, thus promotion can result in a player owning, for example, two or more queens despite starting the game with one.[2] Pawn promotion, or the threat of it, often decides the result in an endgame. Since the queen is the most powerful piece, the vast majority of promotions are to a queen. Promotion to a queen is often called queening; promotion to any other piece is referred to as underpromotion.

 <h5>TIPS & TRICKS</h5>
 <p>After you practice different tactics and strategies of a chess game, it is also beneficial if you consider some thoughts from the master of chess. It may help you motivate yourself and put your heart on the game. Chess masters have their heart in the chess game and they love sharing these tips to us either:-
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
1. By not moving a chess piece a lot of times during opening, you are developing that piece, and you should not move it until after developing the other pieces. Remember to develop pieces that can coordinate properly with one another. Otherwise, your attack may not be strong enough and cause you to fail.
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Fight the urge to make premature attacks on your opponent. Beginners typically lose because they disregard that principle. Keep in mind that an attack must never be done until you have enough force in your field to ensure its success. Attacking prematurely usually results in the move backfiring.
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Stay grounded and do not be selfish. There are times when you may encounter an easy pawn, but it could be a poisoned pawn or a trap, which could give your opponent the opportunity to make a powerful attack. To neutralize the attack, return the material instead of holding on.
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Look for a weak spot in the position of your opponent. This is one of the most important abilities you must learn in advanced chess strategy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
5. Do not make exchanges that can lead to your opponent developing another piece. Instead, exchange an inactive piece with the same but active piece from your opponent.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>6. Hold Your Emotions</strong>
Take your time and relax, no special award for playing super fast. Unless you are playing in an official chess games. Don’t get nervous because your opponent is an experienced chess player, nobody knows your strategies can knock him down. Control your temper even though you have moved your pieces the wrong way, back up and think for the next move. Accept the challenge and determine yourself.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>7. Time Controls</strong>
In a casual chess games, a chess clock isn’t necessary. However, in an official chess tournaments, time control is the critical part of the game therefore chess clock is required. A chess player must be aware of the time limit for each move to avoid flagging. It is called flagging because a flag inside the clock falls down if a player runs out of time. Try to practice playing chess with a chess clock to better enhance your speed in playing the game. It is helpful if you want to sharpen your mind on every pieces you are planning to move.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>8. Position Your Pieces</strong>
Position your pawn and weak squares, learn about space and building strength. Learn the good and bad piece and pieces power. Learn to balance the initiative and concrete factors of a position. Practice to evaluate the position of chess. And lastly learn about defense and prophylactic thinking. “ Today many players, especially young ones, think that the older openings are so thoroughly analyzed that nothing more can be tried. This is a serious mistake. The methods of positional play become deeper and finer each year. Being well acquainted with them it is possible even in openings which seem to be fully explored to find ways to create a real fight” by Tigran Petrosian
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>9. Read Opponents Mind, Analyze Opponents Move</strong>
Every move in chess pieces plays an important role during the entire game. Analyze why your opponent are pushing a certain pieces. What was his motivation? Once you figure out your opponents intentions and game plan, it is much easier to prepare your defense and attack. Even if you are caught by your opponents strategy accept and take note of it. Study and try to apply the same strategy on your next chess games. According to Spassky “ The best indicator of a chess player’s form is his ability to sense the climax of the game”.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>10. Pull Out Your Game Plan</strong>
Make use of your chess notations, your secret strategies and kept techniques. Try different chess strategies that you have learned and observe that works best. Don’t use the same strategies on all your chess games, your opponents can easily read your style. Decide to use different plan in different games, is another chance of discovering new tactics.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>11. Solidify Every Decision, Consider a Second Option</strong>
Former world chess champion Emanuel Lasker say, “ when you see a good move, look for a better one”. Don’t rush! It is easy to decide a good move. Try to visualize the outcome of each pieces you are going to move. It can be in danger or trapped. Balance your decision before you move your most favorable chess piece.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>12. Self-Confidence</strong>
Magnus Carlsen “ self-confidence is very important. If you don’t think you can win, you will take cowardly decisions in the crucial moments, out of sheer respect for your opponent. You see the opportunity but also greater limitations than you should. I have always believed in what I do on the chessboard, even when I had no objective reason to it. It is better to overestimate your prospect than underestimate them”. And yes self-confidence is achieve if you have choke in different strategy and chess techniques.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>13. Play other Games or Play Your Favorite Sports</strong>
“Chess is mind torture” according to Kasparov. To release stress and regain mental strength, open up your heart and mind to play games other than chess. Play other active sports, sports that will strengthen your body and joint muscles. It is important to maintain your gross motor skills to prepare you with your fine motor skills. Fine motor skills involves in writing, reading, thinking and grasping small objects. It is the process of exercising small muscles in our body. And chess games belongs to a fine motor skills, to enhance is to strengthen your gross motor skills first. Gross motor skill is the development of the body muscles such as running, walking, interactive games and active sports.

<h1>CHESS TRAPS</h1>


<p>
  Though opening traps are usually amateurish and would normally be seen in club games, it would be helpful to actually know what are the different opening traps since not all of them are as obvious as the Scholar's mate. Knowing these traps, you can have the upper hand because when one usually seeks to trap someone but it is defended against, he would usually end up with a much worse position than his opponent. 

You can try most of these out on unknowing victims, mostly beginners or when you are playing blitz or bullet games but again, experienced chess players already know these and would usually not fall into them unless they make pre-moves online and you can unknowingly mate them quickly.
</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h1>1. Patzer Trick and the Scholar's Mate</h1>

<p>
  These first two tricks are mostly for beginners. Chess players who have a good grasp of positional play and chess principles would not be fooled or easily trapped. Knowing these would also help you to watch out for them and show your opponents that you will not be caught by cheap tricks. 

Do not worry if you have fallen for these tricks because I have and many others have too. These are just the baby steps of chess and in every mistake that you make, you will be able to pick up lessons and learn from these to improve your skills.

The first one is the Patzer trick. Patzer is a term which means 'a chess amateur' and this is reflected in the set of moves that will be played because these moves are very dubious because they violate the rules of opening theory and chess in general. Nonetheless, I fell for this trick when I was playing chess with a friend in high school because I never really had a grasp of chess knowledge yet so I was just simply stunned and flabbergasted that the game had ended all too quickly. Of course, now that I have come to a better understanding of chess, I have learned how to counteract this trick.

The other beginner trap is the Scholar's Mate which is commonly called the "Four-move checkmate." This is somewhat similar to one line in the Patzer Opening but with a different move order. 


</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h1>2. Fried Liver Attack</h1>

<p>
This is a very interesting line in the Giuoco Piano or Italian Opening where White's minor pieces converge at the weak square f7 to attack the enemy king. The attack can actually go in two different directions since White can either capture the f7 pawn with the bishop or the knight to gain the exchange or to inconvenience Black's king but in turn, Black is able to get a good center so it depends on how both sides play this.

However, the Fried Liver Attack does not always happen because Black can liven up his own position with the move d5 interfering in the coordination of White's bishop and knight. This move also causes the attack to cease so I have since considered this attack to be somehow diluted in its effectiveness unless Black cooperates well enough for it to be executed. Of course, in the event that Black sacrifices his d-pawn for activity, White would have an extra pawn although his pieces are not as stable particularly the night on g5 which can be attacked when Black's knight on f6 moves.


</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h1>3. Legal Trap</h1>

<p>
Now, we are moving on to some complicated stuff with bold sacrifices that lead to beautiful combinations. The key to a successful attacking combination is that the defender would have no possible way of defending his position by any means because there is just too much pressure coming from all sides and so the attacker must always ensure that he is able to utilize his positional advantage to maximum effect since only when one's position is superior and his pieces are active will tactics be most effective and he will easily crush the other side's defenses. The Legal Trap is somewhat a miniature version of a superb attacking combination since it actually uses the concept of a double attack and the concept of a decoy.

The Legal Trap can be initiated by White in the Philidor's Defense and involves a queen sacrifice followed by a mating net. This would also follow the theme of attacking the weakest square in Black's camp held by the f7-pawn. You will be amazed by this trap and how certain high-valued pieces like the queen can become immaterial when looking for checkmate. Moreover, if you notice, both sides were making normal moves in the opening until Black moved his bishop to h5 wherein the trap was sprung. These are the subtleties that we need to be very careful to watch out for not only in this position but in every other position as well.


</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h1>4. Fishing Trap</h1>

<p>
The Fishing Pole Trap is probably one of the most popular, exciting, and effective traps. I personally like this trap because it can be done in the Sicilian Defense, however, it does not always happen the way you would want to especially when your opponent is aware of it but it may lead to some interesting positions that are still quite double-edged in my perspective. There are two versions of the Fishing Pole, one in the Sicilian Defense and the other in the Ruy Lopez. This trap also highlights another theme in chess which is attacking the castled king on the h2 square so one must always be careful where he puts his king because the most dangerous place for your king to be is where you think he is safest at.
</p>


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h1>5. Elephant Trap</h1>

<p>
Most of the traps we have covered all stem out of the e4 openings since 1 e4 leads to very sharp and tactical positions with numerous variations. But there are also certain traps in the d4 openings and the Elephant Trap is one such trap where you will simply be surprised that by releasing the tension between the center pawns and a miscalculation, a crafty trick can be launched. 

</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h1>6. Lasker Trap</h1>

<p>
Also stemming out from the Queen's Gambit Declined line, the Lasker trap, named after Dr. Emanuel Lasker, is a disaster for White which is due to one inaccurate move causing White's position to fall apart after that move and Black totally decimating White's formation and dominating the entire board. In the end, the White king is out in the open and going to be running for his life. In the last position, White is completely devastated.

</p>



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h1>7. Blackburne-Shilling Trap</h1>

<p>
The Blackburne-Shilling Trap is one of the most impressive traps that I have seen so far since the result of this trap is a spectacular smothered mate. This also stems out of the Italian Opening but instead of White delivering the blows, it is Black who confounds White and controls the game although this trap would work only if White cooperates.
 

</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



<h1>DEEP INSIGHTS INTO CHESS TRAPS</h1>

<p>
A common theme that these traps and tricks show us, besides attacking and putting pressure on the weakest squares of your opponent's position, is that one falls for these traps usually due to greediness for material and a general lack of understanding of the aim of certain moves which leads to slight inaccuracies and later on to major blunders. Traps, especially those in the opening, may be fun to execute because your opponents would be surprised and might want to give up easily but these traps do not work for everyone, especially not on experienced players who know quite a bit about chess than the ordinary person. Going for spectacular moves and daring to give up almost everything for the attack may be too risky at times because one misstep would usually cause the whole position of the attacker to collapse which is why many good tacticians do not neglect positional strategy because a good position would always lead to a static or permanent advantage.
<br><br><br>
 Tactics, though they are more dynamic, are only temporary depending on the short-term aspects of the position and may not always finish the job quickly. Rather, tactics should also just be a means to have a better position in the aftermath since not all tactics are decisive and some attacks may water down to nothing.
<br><br><br>

In general, do not panic when your opponent starts to give up his material to attack your king because not all attacks are fully realized or what are called premature attacks. Simply analyze the position first and try to figure out what your opponent wants to do and if you see that there is no substance to his attack, then you can be at peace that you will be safe for the time being and you would not lose right then and there. Just develop your pieces, strengthen your pawn structure, and bring your king to safety instead of making hasty moves. Come up with a good strategy to take advantage of your opponent's rash assault on your position.
