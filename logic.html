<h2> STRATEGY & TACTICS</h2>


  <p>Chess strategy consists of setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages <br> during the game – for example, where to place different pieces – while tactics <br> concentrate on immediate maneuver. These two parts of the chess-playing process<br> cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through <br> tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. <br> A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first<br> 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle;<br> then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings<br> typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.</p>

<h2><span class="funda">TACTICS</span></h2>
</div>
<p>In chess, tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions – so short-term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or by a computer. The possible depth of calculation depends on the player's ability. In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides, a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical, while in "tactical" positions with a limited number of forced variations, strong players can calculate long sequences of moves.

Simple one-move or two-move tactical actions – threats, exchanges of material, and double attacks – can be combined into more complicated combinations, sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players.[12] Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers; for example, pins, forks, skewers, batteries, discovered attacks (especially discovered checks), zwischenzugs, deflections, decoys, sacrifices, underminings, overloadings, and interferences.
There are a lot of definitions about tactics that are completely useless (and do more to cloud the issue than clarify it).

THE OXFORD COMPANION TO CHESS by Hooper and Whyld, says that tactics are “the means by which the strategic plans are carried out.” They also say that “…most, perhaps all, moves have a tactical ingredient, usually the preparation or prevention of threats.”

While “the means by which the strategic plans are carried out” might seem murky, the second part is quite clear: “…most, perhaps all, moves have a tactical ingredient, usually the preparation or prevention of threats.”

One IM told me that he likes to keep things simple, and thus says tactics are manifested on the board as eight motifs: double attack, pin, skewer, X-Ray, discovered attack, removing the guard, mate and stalemate.

Personally, I view tactics as a mix of all the tactical motifs, plus calculations (awareness) that allows you to know whether attacking an enemy unit is effective, while also knowing whether all enemy attacks are to be taken seriously (meaning you need to prevent the threat) or laughed at (meaning you can ignore it).

<h2><span class="funda">STRATEGY</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for the future play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).

The most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides.[15] The point values used for this purpose are based on experience; usually pawns are considered worth one point, knights and bishops about three points each, rooks about five points (the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange), and queens about nine points. The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined, since its checkmate loses the game. But in practical terms, in the endgame the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook.[16] These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece (e.g. advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares), coordination between pieces (e.g. a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight), or the type of position (e.g. knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions).</p>

<h2><span class="funda">COMBINATION</span></h2>
</div>
<p>
  This is how the great Emanuel Lasker defined combinations:

“In the rare instances in which the player can detect a variation, or set of variations, which leads to a desirable issue by force, the totality of these variations and their logical connections, their structure, are called a combination.”

Lasker’s definition is a bit ponderous, and also fails to mention the use of a sacrifice.

Here is Botvinnik’s definition:

“A combination is a forced maneuver or maneuvers combined with a sacrifice as a result of which the active side gains an objective advantage.”

The trouble with this definition is that it fails to describe incorrect combinations or combinations that, with best play, don’t change the status quo (in other words, a combination from an equal position might set the opponent some hard problems to solve, but if he plays properly the position would still offer equal chances).

Seirawan and Silman (from the book, WINNING CHESS TACTICS) came up with their own definition:

“A combination is a sacrifice combined with a forced sequence of moves, which exploits specific peculiarities of the position in the hope of attaining a certain goal.”

This definition makes the most sense to me, since it addresses sacrifice, and the possibility of it ending without an advantage.

Grandmaster Averbach, when addressing combinations, said that all combinations are based in some way on a double attack.

Personally, I agree with Averbach, and I’ve often said that a combination can only exist if the opponent’s King is vulnerable in some fashion, if the opponent has various undefended pieces, or if the opponent has pieces that aren’t adequately guarded.

If you notice one or more of these factors on the board, you should look for a combination. If none of these factors exist, then it’s highly doubtful that a combination will appear.

Finally, THE OXFORD COMPANION TO CHESS had this to say about combinations: “Combinations do not come from thin air. Usually a player will first have gained some kind of positional advantage, thus disorganizing the opponent. It is often said that when the advantage is marked the combinations will come of themselves.”

In a nutshell: A combination has tactics (and a sacrifice), but tactics don’t necessarily have anything to do with a combination. So, what exactly are tactics?
